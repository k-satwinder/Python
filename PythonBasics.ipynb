It was developed by Guido van Rossum.It is known for it's simplicity, readability and versatility. It is popular because of following reasons:\n",

For example, reading files until end of file. Using for loop in this case is not best because we don't know how much iteratons required to read file until end line but in case of while loop it is good because decisions are taken with conditions.\n"
